        <h1>About</h1>
        This is one of the first "projects" I've worked on and I have a lot to say about it.
        Back in the summer of 2022, I decided to learn web development to build my own website. As part of the learning process,
        I decided to build my own sort of web app, ultimately became Torbin. By all accounts, Torbin is an extremely basic website
        built using some very rudimentary HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript. No bells, no whistles, and no frameworks.
        <br><br>
        But to me, there is something charming about the simplicity of Torbin. 
        The lack of coherent CSS, terrible looking design, and general clunkiness all reek of a beginner programmer that does now know what he is doing.
        The beauty of Torbin, to me, is that it represents the start of my journey as a developer. 
        In the years since I first made Torbin, I have gotten the opportunity to learn so much more, not only about web development, 
        but about software in general. It's kind of funny to look back at all of the bizarre design decisions I made when creating Torbin. 
        For example, I did not know what modal components were back then, so the "popups" in Torbin are made by a mix of unneceesary workarounds. 
        There are so many things I could do to improve Torbin, but ultimately it's fun to look back at my past self and reflect on
        my journey so far.
